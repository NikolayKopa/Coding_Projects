<h3>Introduction to Website</h3>
<p> Welcome to my website reader. This website is about my different Magnet classes in Roberto Clemente which have several projects. The projects show many different IB Learner Profiles. IB Learner Profiles are skills that you show in many cases like projects with friends or just normal class activities and group discussions. I will also talk about myself and the purpose of this website on this page also. 
</p>
<h3>Purpose of this Website</h3>
<p>The purpose of this website is just to show some of the fun activities and what skill you use for these activities. The activities are from my school, Roberto Clemente, which has a magnet program which I am in. These projects include lots of thinking but also many other skills that are a part of the IB Learner Profiles. I will also explain the projects and what my outcome was when I tried to do the project. Lastly there will be pictures and images all across the website displaying helpful information.

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>My name is Nick Kopaliani and I am 11 years old. I am a 6th grader at Roberto Clemente Middle School Magnet Program. I like to draw, play video games and skiing. I am a Black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I am learning Python Programming so I could maybe make my own basic video games. I am a good student in school and love doing projects with friends. Our school is named after a famous African-American Baseball player who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1957. This was the breif history of my school's name. I live in the U.S. specificlly Maryland. I am glad to present the rest of my website in the next few pages.
