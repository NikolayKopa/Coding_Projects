<h2>Introduction to Page</h2>
<p>This next page will be discussing another science project that we have done in the Science Magnet Classes. This next project was based on national Parks which were not operating because of the recent Government Shutdown. We got to pick out any national park and then find a endangered specie located in the park. Afterwards we would present our project to the class. The project was very fun and enjoyable. We got to work with our friends and make a beautiful brochure or slideshow. I will be going in depth with this project in the next paragraph.</p>
<h2>National Park Project</h2>
<p> As I said earlier this project is based on the recent Government Shutdown which led to National Parks not being taken care of for a long time, around a month. Luckily the Shutdown ended but for the project we were talking past sense. We first had to choose what National Park we represented out of 30 options. Then we had to do a lot of research on the National Park like the Geography, Food Web and many other important research elements. Afterwards we would make a way to inform the public on this National Park like a brochure or a presentation from Powtoons or Prezi. This would lead to us presenting our project to the class and giving them every important area of information they wanted or needed. This project led me to using many different skills that are very useful in everyday life which I will be listing down below.</p>
<h2>IB Learner Profile</h2>
<p>In my opinion the most important IB Learner Profile for the National Park project was Open-Minded. Open-Minded was the most important IB Learner profile because for the presentations that we had to do for our project we had to respect everyone else's presentations and National Parks like they did to ours. We also had to respect each other's abilities of creating the presentations and also presenting the presentations or else that would be very rude or could make you get in trouble. This IB Learner Profile could help me in the future because this IB Learner Profile allows me to be respectful to everyone’s perspectives and personalities. I have learned so much during this project which in my opinion made me a better person and more Open-Minded.</p>
<b><p>A list of some of the National Parks chosen are shown below:</p></b>
