<h3>Introduction to This Page</h3>
<p>This page of my website focuses on some of the projects I have in my GT Classes, specifically Computer Science Class. In Computer Science we have many fun projects that include thinking and partnership with your groups. These projects are very enjoyable for the students of the class and mostly never gives a person some sadness or boredom. Here is a description for my projects that I had in this class.

<h3>Robotics and Edison Robot</h3>
<p>In our Robotics and Edison Robot Unit we had many things to learn about robots and their jobs. We programmed Edison but before that we had to learn what robots have already or will do for us. We also had to learn the process of doing a project which is very useful to us while doing these two projects. The Edison were very fun to program and it was interesting to see how they moved and what they did with our code. Mostly everyone in our class had fun in this Unit because of all the hands on activities we had to do during the Unit.

<h3>Web Design</h3>
<p>The Web Design Unit was very exciting and I couldn’t wait to start our project but I had to learn all the different ways of doing Web Design and also the way to use HTML the main way to design a website that we will be using. Our project for the Web Design was to create a website. It was fun to see how the code translated into the website I made. This was a very fun Unit and I have used a good IB Learner Profile in it.

<h3>IB Learner Profile</h3> 
<p>I used the IB Learner, Risk-Taker, while doing these two projects. I was a Risk-Taker during the Robotics Unit or project since I had to risk making so many changes to my codes for Edison if something didn’t work. My group friends and I also needed to risk and use the tracks that weren’t well made or flat. In the Web Design project I had to take a risk and try putting or making different pages for each page which could get negative or positive feedback. This IB Learner Profile will help me during Semester 2 since it allows me to change whatever I am doing and substitute it for a new idea. This IB Learner Profile will help me through day to day life since it allows me to risk changing something that is incorrect to something that you wouldn’t know is correct. I learned that I had to use many skills including the one mentioned to be successful in many activities.
