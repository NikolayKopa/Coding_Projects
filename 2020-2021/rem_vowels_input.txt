Global leaders took to social media and the airwaves on New Yearâ€™s Eve to wish their citizens a brighter future. Many acknowledged the sacrifices people made in 2020, and thanked the public for pulling together through an historically difficult year. To date, more than 1.8 million people have died in the Covid-19 pandemic.

In keeping with expectations, US president Donald Trump also found an opportunity to mention with amazement all the people calling to thank him for the success of Operation Warp Speed, a public-private project to accelerate the development and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, though so far the delivery phase of the effort has been slower than expected.
